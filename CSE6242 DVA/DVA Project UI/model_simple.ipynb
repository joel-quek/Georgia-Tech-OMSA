    "1. **Month (extracted from FL_DATE)**:\n",
    "   - **Reason**: Flight delays can exhibit seasonal trends due to factors like holiday travel surges, weather variations (e.g., winter storms), and seasonal flight schedules. By including the month, the model can capture these seasonal patterns, which can impact delay likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **AIRLINE_CODE**:\n",
    "   - **Reason**: Different airlines have varying operational practices, policies, and resources, which can affect their on-time performance. Some airlines may have stricter schedules, while others might be more affected by operational delays. The airline code helps capture these airline-specific characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ORIGIN (Origin Airport Code)**:\n",
    "   - **Reason**: Some airports are more prone to delays due to congestion, local weather patterns, or geographic location. For example, airports in high-traffic cities or regions with frequent bad weather (like New York or Denver) might experience more delays. Including the origin airport helps account for these factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **DEST (Destination Airport Code)**:\n",
    "   - **Reason**: Similar to the origin, the destination airport can influence delays due to factors like local congestion or weather. By including the destination code, the model can recognize patterns related to specific airports that might impact flight arrival times.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **CRS_DEP_TIME (Scheduled Departure Time)**:\n",
    "   - **Reason**: Delays often correlate with peak travel times, such as early morning or late evening hours. Including the scheduled departure time helps the model recognize if certain times of the day are more delay-prone, as flights scheduled during busy periods may face higher delays due to airport congestion or air traffic control limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **CRS_ELAPSED_TIME (Scheduled Flight Duration)**:\n",
    "   - **Reason**: Longer flights may have a different risk profile for delays compared to shorter flights. For instance, longer flights might be more susceptible to in-flight rerouting or weather conditions en route. Scheduled flight duration provides context about the length of the journey, which can influence delay likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **DISTANCE**:\n",
    "   - **Reason**: The distance of the flight can impact delay patterns, as longer flights may have different types of operational challenges. For instance, longer flights might be subject to stricter planning or affected by more complex air traffic control patterns. Including distance allows the model to distinguish between delays on short-haul versus long-haul flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "These features were chosen as they capture a broad range of factors that can contribute to flight delays:\n",

    "- **Airline-specific patterns** (AIRLINE_CODE),\n",
    "- **Airport-specific conditions** (ORIGIN, DEST),\n",
    "- **Time of day** (CRS_DEP_TIME),\n",
    "- **Flight characteristics** (CRS_ELAPSED_TIME and DISTANCE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these predictors give the model context on seasonal, operational, spatial, and scheduling factors that are likely to influence flight delays."
