# GaTech OMSA
## The Origin Story
It was a warm summer evening, circa 2022 A.D., when my friend (hereafter referred to a *Jpsilon*) turned to me and asked, *"Bro, have you ever thought about pursuing a Master's in Data Science?"* Without a moment's pause, I replied, *"Yes."*

Two years later, that simple word unfolded into an unforgettable journey—one that saw exactly one of us cross the finish line.

## The Rubric
I will be rating modules based on two criteria
- Difficulty:
  How challenging the material is and how much effort (or pain) you should be prepared for.
- Relevance
  How practical or valuable I found the module in real-world scenarios.

## My Background
I graduated from the National University of Singapore with an Honors Degree in Mathematics. During my undergrad, I also studied coding (C, MATLAB) and dabbled in Python as a working professional. So, while my ratings are rooted in a STEM background, they might not reflect the experiences of someone with a different academic history.

## The Plot Twist
After submitting my application to the OMSA program, I discovered that my Georgia Tech journey wouldn’t officially begin until Fall 2023. Then, on a chilly evening in 2022, Jpsilon suggested an idea: why not get a head start by taking some of the modules on EdX? The added bonus of potentially earning Advanced Standing credits was a chance too good to pass up.

### ISYE6501 Introduction to Analytics Modelling (EdX)

*Difficulty: 5/10*

*Relevance: 7/10*

*Module Components: Homework and Exams*

The lecture videos were well-produced, and the lecturer, Joel Sokol, is a phenomenal teacher. Expect to cover a wide range of machine learning algorithms and formulas. The homework assignments introduced me to R coding for the first time, which was a valuable learning experience. The lectures provide simple proof sketches for each formula (e.g., the SVM formula), which may give students the impression that the proofs will be tested. However, the exams were multiple-choice and focused on understanding the uses of different models, rather than detailed mathematical proofs. This was the first time in my life where a math exam didn't require any written work and was entirely multiple-choice. Overall, it's an excellent introduction to understanding various machine learning models, their use cases, and serves as a kind of "menu" showing what the OMSA program has to offer students. Dr. Sokol, if you're reading this and ever visit Singapore, let me buy you a meal.

For those who are wondering, here is _The Menu_

### MGT6203 Data Analytics for Business (EdX)
*Difficulty: 4/10*
*Relevance: 8/10*
This course was more Data than Business and introduced students to data transformations like log-log or log-linear transformations. This course has a large project component where I met a stellar group of teammates, especially my best teammate, WS, who went on to do many projects with. We would go to Vormir and collect the Soul Stone. Note that the relevance rating I'm giving is due to the project that we did. We performed a lot of
