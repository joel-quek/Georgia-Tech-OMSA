    "A design of experiments (DOE) strategy would be helpful in the case of increasing a website's or app's conversion rate. Websites and apps are now essential tools for businesses to interact with their clients and boost sales in the digital age. The conversion rate—the percentage of visitors who complete a desired activity, like completing a purchase, filling out a form, or subscribing to a newsletter—is one of the essential indicators for gauging the effectiveness of a website or app.\n",
    "\n",
    "A DOE methodology could be used to methodically test various iterations of the website or app in order to find which modifications have the biggest effects on conversion. The DOE, for instance, can entail testing various iterations of the website or app with various layouts, color schemes, copy, calls to action, and other design features. By randomly allocating users to multiple versions of the website or app and monitoring the conversion rate for each group, the DOE can help uncover the most effective design aspects and advise future design decisions."

    "To determine the value of 10 different yes/no features to the market value of a house (large yard, solar roof, etc.), a real estate agent plans to survey 50 potential buyers, showing a fictitious house with different combinations of features.  To reduce the survey size, the agent wants to show just 16 fictitious houses. Use R’s FrF2 function (in the FrF2 package) to find a fractional factorial design for this experiment: what set of features should each of the 16 fictitious houses have?  Note: the output of FrF2 is “1” (include) or  “-1” (don’t include) for each feature.\n"
