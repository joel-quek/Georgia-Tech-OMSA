    "# Problem 7: Hamlet Sentence Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "Who needs Shakespeare when we've got Python? In the following series of exercises, we will create a function that will generate Shakesepearan-sounding phrases. All of the words in our phrase generator come from Act 3, Scene 1 of Shakespeare's Hamlet. \n",
    "\n",
    "But we won't just be stringing random words together. To make our phrases sound (slightly) coherent, every new word in our phrase will be a word that followed the previous word in the original Shakespearean text.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will accomplish this in three steps. First, we will tidy the text of the scene, breaking each sentence into an ordered list of the words in that sentence. Second, we will create a dictionary where the keys are words from the text, and the values are lists of the words that immediately follow the key words in the dialogue. Finally,  we will create a phrase generator that will use that dictionary by starting with a key word, randomly selecting a word from the list of words that follows it, adding that word to our phrase, and repeating the process."
